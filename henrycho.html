		<h4>History</h4>
			<p>I grew up in Los Angeles, California, where I attended Rosemead High School. During 
			my time in high school, I was interested in the sciences, but it wasn't until my senior 
			year when I decided to join the Science Olympiad team. For me, applying science to 
			engineer efficient devices was much different than solving textbook problems. I have to 
			face the problems of real world effects, where in textbook problems usually assume 
			negligible. Even though I did not have much experience in applying science, I still 
			considered to pursue an engineering degree. I applyed and was accepted to the Uniersity 
			of Michigan's College of Engineering.

		<h4>University of Michigan</h4>
			<p>I was accepted to University of Michigan's College of Engineering undergraduate 
			program, but I still wasn't entirely sure of in which field of engineering I should 
			specialize. Previously, I had decided on aerospace engineering when my father took me 
			to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, but a number of pressing environmental issues has 
			risen since my childhood, so I questioned on whether I should pursue a degree in civil 
			and environmental engineering. I decided when I found out I could still apply my 
			aerospace knowledge to environmental efforts and continues to pursue my childhood 
			dream.
